Key watch points
	Outline of Key Cybersecurity Threat Types
Threat Type
Phishing attack – is a developed malicious file or script allowing aggressive actors in this case via email (email phishing), used the HR Timesheet imitation as an attack vector. In this case of social engineering the attack used email phishing which was used to divert the user to a malicious site to gain login information and access and control of files, this attack also delivered a malware file.
Vulnerability- are the endpoint user understand of social engineering used to access their system or business platforms.
Risk – gain user login details such as password and other platforms within the network having the same password.
Attack- used social engineering, the attacker is able to identify the users such as departments to create user error/manipulation. This occurs through human error related to emails 
Mitigation- Improve users knowledge of cyber security via education and system configurations
	Users education – to look for misspelling in URL’s 
	Audit user passwords system prevention systems
	Identify web-based platforms weaknesses 

Malware attack – is a form of cyber-attack threat that can control the access to the networks and remove system access to users. 
Vulnerability- the attacker is able to gain further unauthorised access to the system.
Risk – the attacker gaining login details leading system access and delivering malicious packages to the system.
Attack- After the malicious software / file is downloaded the action of the malware is to limit/stop users from accessing the required files and system platforms, achieved via, distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks also allow the access to sensitive files.

Mitigation-(Ensure the use of Prevention Best Practice)
	Use training to ensure employees are more aware and are proactive. Include endpoint protection software (EDR) Endpoint Detection Response improve system proactive response to the malware.
	Use of Account policies 
	Patches are updated
